A software engineer passionate about elegant and correct, functional code,
currently working at Repyh Labs. Alternatively, I spend my time leading a

[house](https://spenden.schwyzerstaern.ch/), organising
[cultural events](https://kultursprechstunde.ch/) or loving
[music](https://www.instagram.com/fratelliflex/), food and parties.
